# Mini-Project-Book-App
The Book App Automation System is to automate all operations in a books. Before automating a
bookApp we have to understand the concept of automation. In automationof any operation we make a
system which do work automatically as the respective events occurs,for which it is meant.
There are the some common examples of the Apps like that auto pilot system in theaircraft, automatic
home systems (electric system, water system, fire alarm system, doors system etc). These are best
examples of the automation systems.
Here we are try to develop such type system which is provide the Online on the buy any type of the
books. That means a shop which has the type system which provides the facility to the customers of the
shop to purchase the books from the shop without any complexity.
For example any customer want to purchase any book from the shop than first of all customer just
choose the stream of the book than he/she can see the more then one type of books there and than
he/she can choose the specific book from there. And then purchase it by paying price on Book App
online .

Technical feasibility
For the design and development of the system, several software products have been
accommodated.
Design – Android studio , javascript
Building user interfaces – react native
This software’s have the enough efficiency in producing the system. Therefore the project is
technically feasible.

Design Constraints
The system is based on menu driven interfaces. Menu selection will be done by using the mouse and the
key board keys. Confirmation messages on taken actions, input acceptance and error conditions will
bedisplayed after each input.Error messages will be displayed at the time of detection of input errors
and the system errors.
Attributes:
Qualities of the product

The system is thoroughly tested at the time of delivery so that computational errors
are minimized.
Maintainability :
To make ease of maintain the system to the Book shop administrators the user
manual and the system manual is provided at the delivery. Each module is designed
independently so that at any change of a request can be modified easily.
Security :
